# How2Dev

So you want to become a (better) software engineer? You've come to the right place, as I'll be sharing with you my experience, tooling, workflows, and more.

There aren't many shortcuts if you want to become a good engineer, but I'll hold your hand along the way. As long as you are curious, want to learn, and are stubborn enough (engineering can be frustrating at times), you won't be stopped!

Feel free to download the repository and use any part of it as you see fit. If you found any of this useful make sure to share it with your friends and colleagues:^)

Don't know where to start? Check out the [Development Environment](src/md/dev-environment/README.md) guide.

Sorry for any typos or bugs in advance, I'm only human (ong frfr tho).
