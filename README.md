So you want to become a (better) developer? Well, you've come to the right place (hopefully), as I'll be sharing with you my experience, tooling, workflows, and more.

There are not many shortcuts if you really want to make the most of it, but I'll hold your hand the entire way. That being said, it is gonna be a wild ride, so buckle up!
